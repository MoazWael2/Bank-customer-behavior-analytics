# Credit Card Spending Analysis Queries (My SQL)

### Introduction
Welcome to the Credit Card Spending Analysis Queries repository. This collection of SQL queries has been crafted to provide a high-level overview of spending patterns among credit card customers. Our goal is to enable a data-driven approach to enhance credit card feature recommendations and tailor services to customer needs.The dataset includes transactions made by a vast number of customers over various months and across different spending categories. These transactions reflect the diverse ways customers engage with their credit cards, whether for groceries, healthcare, or other daily expenditures.

### Data Overview
The datasets provided contain detailed records of credit card transactions and customer demographics, structured with the following key fields:
#### Transaction Data:
* customer_id: A unique identifier for each customer.
* month: The month in which the transaction occurred.
* category: The category of the expenditure (e.g., Groceries, Health).
* spend: The amount spent in the transaction.

#### Customer Data:
* customer_id: A unique identifier for each customer, linking to the transaction data.
* age_group: The age group the customer belongs to (e.g., 21-24, 25-34, 45+).
* city: The city of the customer's residence.
* occupation: The customer's occupation, which may influence spending habits.
* gender: The customer's gender.
* marital status: The marital status of the customer, which may be used for targeted marketing.
* avg_income: The average income of the customer, which could correlate with spending behavior.

### Analysis Strategy:
Our data-driven approach to understanding credit card spending behavior is segmented into three focused parts, each with a set of targeted questions designed to unlock valuable insights for business strategy and feature development.

#### Part 1: Spending Behavior Overview:
We begin with an expansive view of general spending patterns. This lays the groundwork for identifying overarching trends and potential areas of focus.
###### Key questions include:
* What is the average monthly spending per customer?
* Which spending categories are most popular among all customers?
* How do spending patterns fluctuate seasonally?
* Are there significant differences in spending between payment methods (e.g., credit card vs. debit card)?
* What is the distribution of transaction sizes across the customer base?
  
#### Part 2: In-Depth Customer Behavior Analysis:
Next, we explore the customer profiles in detail to understand the underlying factors influencing spending behavior.

###### Key questions include:
* How do spending habits vary across different age groups?
* Is there a correlation between the customers' occupations and their spending categories?
* Does marital status influence the frequency or amount of credit card spending?
* Are higher-income customers more likely to engage in certain types of transactions?
* What is the retention rate of customers, and how does it relate to their spending habits?
* Which customer segments demonstrate the highest loyalty or rewards program engagement?
  
#### Part 3: Geographic Spending Behavior Analysis:
Lastly, we assess the geographic distribution of spending, identifying regional trends and local factors that may affect credit card usage.
###### Key questions include:
* Which cities show the highest credit card spending, and in which categories?
* Are there unique spending patterns identifiable in rural versus urban areas?
* How does the economic profile of a city relate to the spending patterns of its residents?
* What regional factors (e.g., local events, economic indicators) might influence spending?
* Can we identify potential for market growth or product expansion based on geographic spending data?
* How does city-wise merchant diversity impact spending behavior?
###### By thoroughly addressing each set of questions, we'll develop a nuanced understanding of our customers' spending behaviors. This will enable us to tailor credit card features and marketing initiatives that resonate with customer needs and preferences, aligned with regional characteristics and opportunities.
